	\section{Regression based approach for link residual time prediction(RLRP)}
	MANET is infrastructure less network form by mobile nodes. These mobile nodes communicate to each other via single hop or multiple hops. Mobility is a key attribute, this causes route failure because the topology of the network changes frequently. So for predicting the future of network topology, link residual time prediction is an important field.
	\par 
	Proposed approach is based on column Mobility Model ~\cite{r15} of mobile nodes it assumes that each node broadcast hello packets to inform its availability in the range. When neighbour node receives hello packet from a sender it uses its signal strength (RSSI Value) to estimate the distance between them.
	------
	monotonically decreasing sequence of RSSI indicates that nodes are moving away from each other and link between them may break down in future. -----.
	\par
	Regression-based approach for link residual time prediction(RLRP) is based on least square polynomial regression. Regression is a better approach than interpolation ~\cite{r16} because interpolation looks for the predicted form of function but in regression looks for a function that minimizes error, this needs a good approximation. 
	
	The following steps are discussed below: 
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Let node $i$ and $j$ are any two neighbour nodes of MANET.
		\item Node $i$  broadcasts hello packets of constant predefined signal strength at periodic intervals.
		\item Neighboring node $j$ receives these packets and  maintains a record of RSSI (received signal strength indication) and packet arrival time in a table. RSSI is a measurement of the signal strength in recieved radio signal. Let $RSSI_{i,j_{1}},RSSI_{i,j_{2}},......RSSI_{i,j_{m}}...\\
		.....RSSI_{i,j_{n}}$ are signal strengths of recieved hello packets by  $j$th node transmitted from  $i$th node recieved at time  $t_{i,j_{1}},t_{i,j_{2}},......t_{i,j_{m}}.....t_{i,j_{n}}$ respectively.
		\item When node $j$ observes a monotonically decreasing pattern of received signal strengths of hello packets as in equation~\ref{eqn:rssi}; In considered case let $m$th onward packets have monotonically  decreasing RSSI valuues then:
		\begin{equation}
		\label{eqn:rssi}
		RSSI_{i,j_{m}}>RSSI_{i,j_{m+1}}>RSSI_{i,j_{m+2}}.....>RSSI_{i,j_{m+n}}
		\end{equation}
		A set ${\Re}_{i,j}$ as equation~\ref{eqn:set} is formulated with above monotonically decreasing hello packet signal strengths and times as elements.
		\begin{equation}
		\label{eqn:set}
		{\Re}_{i,j}= \left\lbrace (RSSI_{i,j_{m}},t_{i,j_{m}}),(RSSI_{i,j_{m+1}},t_{i,j_{m+1}}), \\
		...,(RSSI_{i,j_{m+p}},t_{i,j_{m+p}})...\\
		,(RSSI_{i,j_{m+n}})\right\rbrace 
		\end{equation}
		
		\item Least square polynomial regression based link failure prediction module is invoked.
		\begin{itemize} 
			\item Following is the representation of quadratic model which relates elements of set ~\ref{eqn:set}.
			\begin{equation}% ##-- EQUATION TEMPLATE --##
			\begin{aligned}
			\left[\begin{matrix}RSSI_{i,j_{m}} \\RSSI_{i,j_{m+1}}\\ \vdots\\RSSI_{i,j_{m+p}}\\ \vdots\\RSSI_{i,j_{m+n}}
			\end{matrix} \right] = \left[\begin{matrix} t^{2}_{m} & t_{m} & 1\\t^{2}_{m+1} & t_{m+1} & 1\\   \vdots & \vdots & \vdots\\t^{2}_{m+p} & t_{m+p} & 1 \\  \vdots & \vdots & \vdots  \\t^{2}_{m+n} & t_{m+n} & 1 \end{matrix} \right] 
			*\left[\begin{matrix}  a_{ij} \\ b_{ij} \\ c_{ij}\end{matrix} \right]             
			\end{aligned}\label{eq:six}
			\end{equation}
			\item Equation:~\ref{eq:seven} is simplified representation of equation:~\ref{eq:six}. 
			\begin{equation}% ##-- EQUATION TEMPLATE --##
			\begin{aligned}
			\varUpsilon_{ij}     = \varPhi_{ij} *\varTheta _{ij}
			\end{aligned}\label{eq:seven}
			\end{equation}     
			where 
			\begin{equation}% ##-- EQUATION TEMPLATE --##
			\begin{aligned}
			\varUpsilon_{ij} =\left[\begin{matrix}RSSI_{i,j_{m}} \\RSSI_{i,j_{m+1}}\\ \vdots\\RSSI_{i,j_{m+p}}\\ \vdots\\RSSI_{i,j_{m+n}}
			\end{matrix} \right] , \varPhi_{ij} =\left[\begin{matrix} t^{2}_{m} & t_{m} & 1\\t^{2}_{m+1} & t_{m+1} & 1\\   \vdots & \vdots & \vdots\\t^{2}_{m+p} & t_{m+p} & 1 \\  \vdots & \vdots & \vdots  \\t^{2}_{m+n} & t_{m+n} & 1 \end{matrix} \right] ,       \varTheta _{ij}=\left[\begin{matrix}  a_{ij} \\ b_{ij} \\ c_{ij}\end{matrix} \right] 
			\end{aligned}\label{eq:eight}
			\end{equation} 
			\item Least Square estimate ~\cite{r17} $\hat{\varTheta_{ij}}$ of vector parameter $\varTheta _{ij}$ of equation:~\ref{eq:seven} is following: 
			\begin{equation}% ##-- EQUATION TEMPLATE --##
			\begin{aligned}
			\hat{\varTheta_{ij}}={(\varPhi^{T}\varPhi)}^{-1}\varPhi^{T}\varUpsilon_{ij}
			\end{aligned}\label{eq:eight}
			\end{equation} 
			\item In this way one can estimate values of $\hat{a}_{ij}$,$\hat{b}_{ij}$ and $\hat{c}_{ij}$ and express  signal strength  of $i\Leftrightarrow j$th link $RSSI_{ij}$. Equation:~\ref{eq:nine} represents best fit quadretic polynomial of signal strength with respect to time.
			\begin{equation}% ##-- EQUATION TEMPLATE --##
			\begin{aligned}
			RSSI_{ij} = \hat{a}_{ij} t^{2} + \hat{b}_{ij}t + \hat{c}_{ij}
			\end{aligned}\label{eq:nine}
			\end{equation}        
			\item By antenna characteristics threshold value of signal strength $RSSI_{thresh}$ ~\cite{r12} , min signal strength rquired  to be detected by reciever antenna is a known parameter. Solution of equation:~\ref{eq:ten} will provide estimate of time$\tau_{i,j_{break}}$ when link will break. 
			\begin{equation}% ##-- EQUATION TEMPLATE --##
			\begin{aligned}
			RSSI_{thresh} = \hat{a}_{ij} t^{2} + \hat{b}_{ij}t + \hat{c}_{ij}
			\end{aligned}\label{eq:ten}
			\end{equation}    
			Value of $\tau_{i,j_{break}}$ can be calculated with help of Sridharacharya formulae ~\cite{r13}.
			\begin{equation}% ##-- EQUATION TEMPLATE --##
			\begin{aligned}
			\tau_{i,j_{break}} =\frac{-\hat{b}_{ij} \pm \sqrt{\hat{b}_{ij}^{2}-4\hat{a}_{ij}\hat{c}_{ij}}}{2\hat{a}_{ij}}
			\end{aligned}\label{eq:eleven}
			\end{equation}            
			
			This computed value $\tau_{i,j_{break}}$ is the estimated time when link between $i_{th}$ and $j_{th}$ node will break.  
		\end{itemize}
		\item When Current time= $\tau_{i,j_{break}}- \delta$,  where $\delta$ is very small time; corrective action is taken to prevent packet drop.    
		
		
	\end{enumerate}
	
	
	
	
	
	\section{ Simulation Results and Analysis}
	The proposed approach is based on AODV routing protocol. NS-2.35 ~\cite{r14} tool is used for simulation. NS2.35 is an open source tool which is used for research in networking. 
	
	\subsection{Experimantal setup}
	Column Mobility Model ~\cite{r15} is used for representing mobility of node. In column mobility model, a set of mobile nodes are moving linearly from one location to another location. Velocity of nodes varies from 2 m/s to 10m/s. The simulation area is 500*500, omni-direction antenna model and two-way ray ground radio propagation model are used. In Table~\ref{tab1} detailed parameters for simulation are summarized.

	\end{table}    
	Table~\ref{tab2} is representing a comparison of estimated link residual time with actual link residual time for a 5 node manet with node velocity 2m/sec. On observing the data one can conclude that the present algorithm is generating remarkable performance in terms of accurate estimation of link residual time.
	
	\par Root-mean-square error (RMSE) of link residual time  calculated  as following equation:~\ref{eq:e1}is chosen as performance measure:
	\begin{equation}% ##-- EQUATION TEMPLATE --##
	\begin{aligned}
	RMSE_{v}=\sqrt{\dfrac{1}{L}\sum_{k=1}^{L} (\tau_{k,v_{break}}-\tau_{k,v_{actual}})^{2}}
	\end{aligned}\label{eq:e1}
	\end{equation} 
	where    $RMSE_{v}$ is  Root-mean-square error (RMSE) of link residual time at node velocity $v$m/sec, $\tau_{k,v_{break}}$ and  $\tau_{k,v_{actual}}$ are estimated and actual link residual times of any $k_{th}$ link of MANET of total $L$ links with node velocity $v$ respectivey.        
	
	
	\par
	Fig:~\ref{Fig1} shows the comparison of RMSE for the different sets of n points with monotonically decreasing pattern of received signal strengths of hello packet used in the least square polynomial regression wrt velocity of nodes. It can be concluded that increasing node velocity is not directly affecting RMSE value of link residual time; means estimated link residual time is immune to node velocity scaling. 
	\par
	There are three different curves showing RMSE vs node velocity relationship with varying number of hello packets of monotonically decreasing RSSI appearing in the figure:~\ref{Fig1}. It can be concluded that with an increasing value of $n$ there is again in RMSE value of error but since computational overhead is also increasing with $n$. Hence in this algorithm, an optimal value $n=5$ has been chosen.

		\end{figure}
	\end{center}
	\par    
	Fig.~\ref{Fig2} shows a comparison between regression and interpolation based approaches of link residual time estimation. From the figure, it can be concluded that by adapting regression-based approaches one can have an edge over interpolation based approaches. Mathematically, regression-based approaches uses a polynomial pattern within considered points; means there is no guarantee that polynomial will pass through at least one chosen point. On the other hand, interpolation provides curve fitting type solution; means it is guaranteed that a $n_{th}$ degree polynomial will pass through n selected points. In this, although it is guaranteed that there will be zero error at considered n points but for other points in the domain this polynomial will not provide a solution with the optimal error.
	Although in both cases this polynomial is extrapolated as in equation:~\ref{eq:ten} to find a solution for link residual time, yet the regression polynomial is better approximated for this point.

	\section{Conclusion}
	The authors have presented a novel approach for link residual time prediction based upon cross-layer optimization and least square quadratic regression. Although these approaches are very powerful tools of contemporary researchers of networking community yet there are very limited examples of simultaneous use of both for link residual time prediction. Results are very promising and the algorithm is very simple in terms of implementation.
